# On the Optimality of the Stationary Solution of Secrecy Rate Maximization for MIMO Wiretap Channel

This repo is cloned from this CodeOcean capsule, which contains the code for the following scientific paper:

Anshu Mukherjee, Vaibhav Kumar, Eduard Jorswieck, Bj√∂rn Ottersten, and Le-Nam Tran, "On the Optimality of the Stationary Solution of Secrecy Rate Maximization for MIMO Wiretap Channel," IEEE Wireless Commun. Lett., vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 357-361, Feb. 2022.

## Instructions
"**Fig1a.m**" and "**Fig1b.m**" show the convergence of Algorithm 1 for degraded and nondegraded channels, respectively. They make use of [Yalmip](https://yalmip.github.io/) as a parser and [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) as the internal convex conic solver for speed. Code Ocean automatically provides these packages (see environment/postInstall). You can download the code and run it on your local machine, but you need to manually install these packages yourself.
